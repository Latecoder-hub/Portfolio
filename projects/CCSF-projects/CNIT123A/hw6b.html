        <p>If you own, manage, monetize, or promote online content via Google Search, this guide is meant for you. You
            might be the owner of a growing and thriving business, the website owner of a dozen sites, the SEO
            specialist in a web agency or a DIY SEO expert passionate about the mechanics of Search: this guide is meant
            for you. If you're interested in having a complete overview of the basics of SEO according to our best
            practices, you are indeed in the right place. This guide won't provide any secrets that'll automatically
            rank your site first in Google (sorry!), but following the best practices will hopefully make it easier for
            search engines to crawl, index, and understand your content.</p>
        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is often about making small modifications to parts of your website. When
            viewed individually, these changes might seem like incremental improvements, but when combined with other
            optimizations, they could have a noticeable impact on your site's user experience and performance in organic
            search results. You're likely already familiar with many of the topics in this guide, because they're
            essential ingredients for any web page, but you may not be making the most out of them.</p>
